#Malaria Detection using CNN from Sctratch and Transfer Learning

Introduction

Malaria is a mosquito-borne infectious disease that affects humans and other animals. 
Malaria causes symptoms that typically include fever, tiredness, vomiting, and headaches.
In severe cases, it can cause yellow skin, seizures, coma, or death. 
Symptoms usually begin ten to fifteen days after being bitten by an infected mosquito. 
If not properly treated, people may have recurrences of the disease months later.

Causes and Symptoms of Malaria

Malaria is caused by Plasmodium parasites. 
The parasites are spread to people through the bites of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes, called "malaria vectors." 
There are 5 parasite species that cause malaria in humans, and 2 of these species – P. falciparum and P. vivax – pose the greatest threat.

Diagnosis of Malaria 

Microscopic Diagnosis
Malaria parasites can be identified by examining under the microscope a drop of the patient’s blood, spread out as a “blood smear” on a microscope slide. 
Prior to examination, the specimen is stained to give the parasites a distinctive appearance. 
This technique remains the gold standard for laboratory confirmation of malaria.
However, it depends on the quality of the reagents, of the microscope, and on the experience of the laboratorian.

Datasets and Experimental Requirements

“Malaria Cell Images Dataset” from Kaggle was used for this study consisting of images of 139×148 pixels.
