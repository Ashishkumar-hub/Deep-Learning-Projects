Multi-label classification involves predicting zero or more class labels.

Unlike normal classification tasks where class labels are mutually exclusive, multi-label classification requires specialized algorithms that support predicting multiple mutually non-exclusive classes or â€œlabels.

Here i am doing multi-label text classification, a document or text snippet can belong to multiple classes. 

Approach: i tried to classify Wikipedia comments into one or more categories of so-called toxic comments. 

Categories of toxic online behavior include:
1. toxic  
2. severe_toxic 
3. obscene 
4. threat  
5. insult and 
6. identity_hate.
